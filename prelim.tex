\section{Preliminaries}

In this manuscript, we consider a two-layer network with the hidden-layer width $p$, and for any input dataset $\{x_i\}_{i=1}^n$ with $n$ samples and $x_i\in\Rd$ for $i\in[n]$, the network $f$ outputs 
\begin{align}\label{eqn:nonlinear-network}
    f(X) = \frac{1}{\sqrt p}\beta\transpose\psi(WX\transpose),
\end{align}
where $\psi$ denotes the element-wise activation function, $W\in\Rpd$ denotes the first-layer forward-connection weights, $\beta\in\Rp$ represents the second-layer weights, and $X\in\Rnd$ is the design matrix formed by concatenating the training samples $x_i$'s as row vectors. 
Without loss of generality, we consider a normalized label $y$, where $|y_i|\leq 1$ for all $i\in[n]$.
We focus especially on a simple squared error loss $L = \frac{1}{2}\|f(X)-y\|^2$. Given data $(X,y)$, we denote $f(t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt p}\beta(t)\transpose\psi(W(t)X\transpose)$ to be the network output at time $t$ and $L(t) = \frac{1}{2}\|f(t)-y\|^2$ to be the corresponding squared error loss.

\paragraph{Backpropagation on two-layer network.}

The usual backpropagation scheme updates the weight parameters following gradient direction. In particular, for two-layer network the update rules on $W$ and $\beta$ write $W(t+1) = W(t) - \eta \frac{\partial L(t)}{\partial W(t)}$ and $\beta(t+1) = \beta(t) - \eta \frac{\partial L(t)}{\partial \beta(t)}$, where $\eta$ denotes the learning rate for gradient descent. The gradient information for weight parameters not only includes the backpropagated error signals but also consists of non-local information on weight parameters from top layers. More specifically, the gradient on the second-layer weights $\frac{\partial L(t)}{\partial \beta(t)} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{p}} \psi(W(t) X\transpose) (f(t) - y)$ contains only the second-layer inputs $\psi(W(t) X\transpose)$ and error signal $f(t) - y$, while the gradient on the first-layer weights 
\begin{align}\label{eqn:backprop-gradient}
    \frac{\partial L(t)}{\partial W(t)} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{p}} [(\beta (f(t) - y)\transpose)\circ \psi'(W(t)X\transpose)] X,
\end{align}
requires not only the local input $X$, local output $W(t)X\transpose$, and error signal $f(t) - y$, but also the information on the second-layer weights $\beta$.
This requires the feed-forward connections between layers to be identical with the corresponding backward connections, and this requirement on synaptic symmetry is regarded as not biological plausible \citep{lillicrap2016random}. 

\paragraph{Feedback alignment on two-layer network.}

One of the alternative approaches proposed to improve the biological plausibility over backpropagation is \emph{Feedback Alignment}, which replaces the feed-forward weights by an independent fixed random backpropagation weights at each layer as backward weights \citep{lillicrap2016random}. In particular, for two-layer networks considered in this work, the second-layer weights $\beta$ is replaced with a fixed random backpropagation weights $b\in\Rp$ at the gradient update while the gradient update on $\beta$ remains the same. By replacing the $\beta$ vector with $b$ in \cref{eqn:backprop-gradient}, the gradient update for $W$ becomes
\begin{align}\label{eqn:alignment-update}
    W(t+1) = W(t) - \frac{\eta}{\sqrt{p}} [(b (f(t) - y)\transpose)\circ \psi'(WX\transpose)] X.
\end{align}
After the substitution, the backpropagation update on $W(t)$ no longer depends on $\beta(t)$ directly and there is no requirement on synaptic symmetry. \cref{algo:fa} shows the feedback alignment algorithm, where $\psi'$ is applied entry-wisely on the matrix and the shorthand $e(t) \defeq f(t) -y$ denotes the error made by the network $f$ in predicting $y$. Note that the dynamics of $\beta(t)$ also do not follow the gradient flow path anymore considering its joint dynamics with $W(t)$. Even though we originally start from a loss function $L$ and the gradient descent dynamics on such function, we end up arriving at this dynamics for feedback alignment that do not directly relate to any loss function.

Feedback alignment is named after its phenomenon of alignment between the feed-forward weights and the fixed backpropagation weights during training. In the case of two-layer network, the alignment is represented as the positive inner product between two vectors $\beta$ and $b$. More specifically, we define alignment as the following.
\begin{definition}\label{def:alignment}
    A series of vectors $\{\beta(t)\}_{t=0}^\infty$ align with a fixed vector $b$ if there exists a constant $c>0$ and time $T_c$ such that for all $t > T_c$ it holds
    \begin{align*}
        \cos\angle(b, \beta(t)) = \frac{b\transpose \beta(t)}{\|b\|\|\beta(t)\|} \geq c.
    \end{align*}
\end{definition}
